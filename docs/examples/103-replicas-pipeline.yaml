      This example shows a example of having multiple replicas of a single step.

      This one automatically scales up depending on the number of messages pending processing.

      The ratio is defined as the number of pending messages per replica:

      ```
      replica = pending / ratio
      ```

      The number of replicas will not scale beyond the min/max bounds (except when *peeking*, see below):

      ```
      min <= replica <= max
      ```

      * `min` is used as the initial number of replicas.
      * If `ratio` is undefined no scaling can occur; `max` is meaningless.
      * If `ratio` is defined but `max` is not, the step may scale to infinity.
      * If `max` and `ratio` are undefined, then the number of replicas is `min`.
      * In this example, because the ratio is 1000, if 2000 messages pending, two replicas will be started.
      * To prevent scaling up and down repeatedly - scale up or down occurs a maximum of once a minute.
      * The same message will not be send to two different replicas.

      ### Scale-To-Zero and Peeking

      You can scale to zero by setting `min: 0`. The number of replicas will start at zero, and periodically be scaled
      to 1  so it can "peek" the number of pending messages can be measured and the targe number of replicas re-calculated.
