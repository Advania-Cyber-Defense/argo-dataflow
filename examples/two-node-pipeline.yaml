      This example shows a example of having two nodes in a pipeline.

      They are connected by a subject.

      By convention, subjects should be the two node names with a hyphen.

      If the first node is named `foo` and the second is named `bar`, then the subject should be `foo-bar`.

      Subjects names only need to be unique within the pipeline.
